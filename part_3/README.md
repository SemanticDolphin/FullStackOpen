# Part 3

No source code in this part of the repository due to the project in part 3 being deployed on Render, which necessitated a separate git repository for easy deployment. Although I could have explored alternatives such as git submodules(idk) or invested more time in working with Render, I opted to focus on completing the exercises for now. Nevertheless, I have made all the exercises available on GitHub, which you can access via my profile or by clicking on the links below
